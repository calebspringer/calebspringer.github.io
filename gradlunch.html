	<h2> What We Did: </h2>
	<ul>
		<li> 
			On <b>Fridays @ 12:10 PM</b>, Penn State graduate students in mathematics will meet in the linked <a href="https://psu.zoom.us/j/95216408409?pwd=dXlwd3NwS2tHR2FpbVJVMXNabTZxdz09">Zoom meeting</a>. 
		</li>
		<br>
		<li> 
			Students are encouraged to virtually attend while eating lunch, or possibly another meal, depending on your sleep schedule and time zone! 
		</li>
		<br>
		<li> 
			After socializing (around <b>12:30 PM </b>), a grad student will give a casual <b>20-30 minute talk</b> (see below). The talks are intended to be understandable by all graduate students, regardless of their year or specialty! 
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		If you are interested in <i>speaking</i>, please send me an email: <a href="mailto:cks5320@psu.edu">cks5320@psu.edu</a>.  We will also actively recruit students to make sure that the talks represent a wide variety of research areas!

There are well-known analytical identifications of these functions, but there is also a less known topological identification of these functions, which I will be talking about. </par>

				<par> "Imaging" describes a broad array of inverse problems in the applied sciences. Fundamentally, this problem involves inverting solutions to the wave equation, a task which is computationally infeasible in practice. Further, in many situations such as geological imaging, the medium in which waves propagate is unknown and must be modelled as random. In this talk, I will outline the basic challenges, modelling approaches, and proposed solutions to this problem. </par>

				<par> Cryptosystems are protected by the assumption that certain number-theoretic problems are hard. But with the advent of quantum computers and quantum algorithms, there is a need to develop cryptosystems based on even harder problems. We will discuss one such problem, based on finding certain maps between certain types of elliptic curves. If time permits, we will also discuss the quaternion algebra analogue of the l-isogeny path problem.  </par>

				<par> While most of us believe the Earth to be a sphere, the writer Samuel Rowbotham proposed in the 1849 pamphlet Zetetic Astronomy that the Earth is instead a flat disk surrounded by a wall of ice.  We investigate his claim using topological data analysis. In particular, we give an introduction to persistent homology, a technique for estimating the underlying structure of a metric space using the distances between points sampled from the space. We attempt to use persistent homology to compute the shape of the Earth, using the price of the cheapest flight available on Kayak.com as a proxy for distance.  </par>

				<par> Abelian varieties combine geometry and algebra in one beautiful package.  On the one hand, they are smooth projective varieties that can be studied and appreciated purely geometrically.  On the other hand, abelian varieties also have an abelian group law on the set of points. In fact, we can view this group as a module in a very natural way. This leads us to ask: Given an abelian variety, can we describe the module structure?  We will discuss known results, starting with elliptic curves, in the context of finite fields.</par>

				<par>Elliptic Curves are geometric objects which also carry useful algebraic structure.  Hilbert's tenth problem asks if there is an algorithm to determine whether integer polynomials have integer solutions.  It turns out that there is a surprising connection between the two.  In this introductory-level talk I will give some basic facts about elliptic curves and their connection to Hilbert's tenth problem in rings of number-theoretic interest, before outlining a few recent results on the subject (including my own). </par>

				<par>During his time captive in prison in Saratov, Jean Poncelet developed one of his most important works, <i>Trait&eacute; des propri&eacute;t&eacute;s projectives des figures, </i> establishing the foundations of projective geometry. One of his most famous results is the Poncelet Porism (which gives rise to a special family of polygons known as Poncelet polygons). It is surprising that, even though this result has been around for more than 200 years, we still find questions without an answer relating to these families of polygons.</par>
				<br><br>

				<par>During this talk, I will present a few recent results and a sketch of the tools and techniques used to solve these problems. The talk will include a glimpse into some open questions in the field. </par>

	<h2> Information for speakers </h2>

	<p> Please plan a talk which is between <b>20-30 minutes</b> long and can be understood by all grad students, regardless of their status or specialization. You will probably only have enough time to motivate, describe and solve one single problem.  Please feel free to forfeit generality in favor of simplicity. The talk should give non-specialists a "taste" of what you do.</p>

	<h3>Things we love to see:</h3>
